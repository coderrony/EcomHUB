Iâ€™m thrilled to share that I have successfully completed the final course assignment for the Learn with Sumit - Reactive Accelerator program! ðŸŽ“ It was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience where I not only fulfilled all the requirements but also implemented additional key features to enhance the overall e-commerce functionality.

4. Product Details, Cart, and Wishlist
5. Search and Filter Functionality:
- Implemented a robust search feature and sidebar filters for Categories, Price, Size, and Color.
6. Order Checkout & Invoice Generation:
